jason-s-post-reinstall-commands
===============================
a little python file AND a shell script of all commands I run after reinstalling. 


Use:
---------
1. Copy the text from python conkat.py and save the file conkat.py


1. `python conkat.py`


 script must first be processed via conkat.py which
removes all the unnessary white space.

this shell script...
  creates directories:
    ~/.ssh
    ~/Workspace
    ~/extras
    ~/extras/Programs/    (node goes in here)
    
  installs:
    git  (generates SSH key, prompts for github
